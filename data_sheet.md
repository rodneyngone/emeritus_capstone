# Datasheet Template

## Motivation

- This dataset of daily Gold OHLCV prices was created to follow the daily fluctutations of gold  
- Batucan Senkal created the data

 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume and Currency data
- How many instances of each type are there? 5703 instances
- Is there any missing data? No missing data, however, there are some zero volume days
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? No
## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? The dataset was collected from open sources
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? The dataset starts in the year 2000 and presumably there are prices before the year 2000 that weren't collected
- Over what time frame was the data collected? Daily

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? No pre-processing
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? Any form of analysis that requires gold prices or volumes traded during the day
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
No
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
No

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? via Kaggle
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)? Yes, the CC0:  Public Domain license
