Logistic Regression HyperParameter Optimisation

Grid Search implementation for a Logistic Regression model to predict one-day ahead returns for Gold daily prices

## DATA
Gold daily candle bars from 2000 to 2022 obtained from Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/daily-gold-price-historical-data 

## MODEL 
Regularized Logistic Regression was chosen to avoid overfitting

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
Hyperparameters: Solver, regularisation penalty norm and regularisation constant

## RESULTS
Results were better than random but clearly more data is needed and richer features
